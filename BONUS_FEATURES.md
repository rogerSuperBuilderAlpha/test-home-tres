**Code Location:** `lib/verification.ts` - `verifyGovernmentWarning()`

---

### 2. Refined OCR Results (Fuzzy Matching) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Requirement:** "Incorporate some logic to handle OCR errors or text mismatches more smartly... using techniques like edit distance"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **Levenshtein distance algorithm** - Calculates edit distance between strings
- ‚úÖ **Similarity percentage** - Converts distance to 0-100% similarity score

  - "O" vs "0" (letter O vs zero)
  - "l" vs "1" (lowercase L vs one)
  - Missing/extra spaces
  - Minor typos
  - Case variations
- ‚úÖ **Smart fallback:**
  - Try exact match first (100% confidence)
  - Then substring match (90% confidence)
  - Finally fuzzy match (calculated confidence)

**Example:**
- Form: "Old Tom" 
- Label OCR: "Old Tome" (OCR error)
- Result: ‚úÖ Match (85% confidence) - Accepted!

**Code Location:** 
- `lib/verification.ts` - `levenshteinDistance()`, `calculateSimilarity()`
- Applied in all field verification functions

  - **Brand/Product Type:** String similarity via Levenshtein
  - **ABV:** Numerical difference (100% - 20% per 1% diff)
  - **Volume:** Unit match + number accuracy
  - **Warning:** Percentage of required phrases found
- ‚úÖ **Visual display:** Small badge next to each result
- ‚úÖ **PDF export:** Confidence scores included in report

**Visual Example:**
```
‚úÖ Brand Name: Match [95% confidence]
‚ùå Alcohol Content: Mismatch [45% confidence]
```

**Code Location:** All verification functions in `lib/verification.ts`

---

### 4. Multiple Product Types ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Requirement:** "Allow the form to handle different beverage types (e.g. Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits) with slightly different required fields or checks"

**Implementation:**

    e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay
‚îî‚îÄ> Sulfites Declaration [optional]
    Wine labels typically include "Contains Sulfites"...
```

**Code Location:** `components/LabelForm.tsx` - Dynamic rendering based on `beverageCategory`

---

### 5. Polish and UX Improvements ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
