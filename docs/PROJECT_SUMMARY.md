## 🚀 Next Steps: Testing & Deployment

### Step 1: Set Up Environment (Required!)

Before testing or deploying, you **must** set up your OpenAI API key:

```bash
# Create .env.local file
cp env.template .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**How to get an OpenAI API key:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create new secret key
5. Copy and paste into `.env.local`

### Step 2: Test Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Test with:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000/test-label-generator.html
2. Right-click on the generated label and save as image
3. Go back to http://localhost:3000
4. Fill out the form with matching data
5. Upload the saved label image
6. Click "Verify Label"

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Perfect Match (all fields correct)
- ❌ Brand Name Mismatch
- ❌ ABV Mismatch  
- ❌ Missing Government Warning
- 🚫 Unreadable/Blurry Image

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

Detailed instructions in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md), but quick steps:

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub (if not already done)
git add .
git commit -m "Complete TTB Label Verification App"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to vercel.com and import your GitHub repo

# 3. Add environment variable in Vercel:
#    OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-key

# 4. Deploy!
```

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### OCR Strategy

**Chosen:** OpenAI Vision API (GPT-4o)
- ✅ Highest accuracy for stylized text
- ✅ Understands context and structure
- ✅ Returns structured JSON
- ✅ Handles various image qualities

**Alternative considered:** Tesseract OCR (free, local, but lower accuracy)

### Matching Algorithm

**Approach:** Deterministic rule-based matching
- Text normalization (lowercase, whitespace collapse)
- Substring matching for brand/type
- Numerical extraction and comparison for ABV/volume
- Unit normalization (mL = ml = milliliters)
- Tolerance for minor variations (±0.1% ABV)

**Why not ML-based?** Overkill for this use case; deterministic is faster, testable, and transparent.

### Error Handling Philosophy

1. **Validate early** - Check inputs before processing
2. **Fail gracefully** - Never crash, always show helpful message
3. **Guide users** - Tell them what to do next
4. **No jargon** - User-friendly error messages

## 📸 Testing Evidence

Once you've tested locally, consider capturing:
- Screenshot of form filled out
- Screenshot of image upload
- Screenshot of successful verification
- Screenshot of failed verification with discrepancies
- Screenshot of error state

Include these in your submission to demonstrate functionality!

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **API Dependency** - Requires OpenAI API key and internet
2. **OCR Accuracy** - Stylized fonts may reduce accuracy
3. **Cost** - ~$0.01 per verification (OpenAI API)
4. **Single Language** - English only
5. **No Persistence** - Results not saved (no database)
6. **Basic Fuzzy Matching** - Could be more sophisticated

All limitations are documented with potential solutions in [APPROACH.md](APPROACH.md).
